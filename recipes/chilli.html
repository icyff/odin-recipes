    <h1>What is Authentic Cincinnati Chili?</h1>
    <p> Cincinnati chili (or Cincinnati-style chili) is a meat sauce with Mediterranean-inspired flavors that’s traditionally used to top spaghetti or hot dogs.</p>
    <p> It’s similar to chili con carne, but it’s different in flavor and texture. It’s also used primarily as a topping, while chili con carne is usually served in a bowl.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef: This Cincinnati chili recipe starts with two pounds of lean ground beef. </li>
        <li>Water: Boil the meat in about a quart of water. </li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: Finely chopped onions and garlic lend bold flavor. </li>
        <li>Tomato sauce: Canned tomato sauce is the perfect rich base. </li>
        <li>Vinegar: Two tablespoons of vinegar bring welcome brightness. </li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce: Worcestershire sauce takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
        <li>Chocolate: Unsweetened chocolate is the secret ingredient that adds rich flavor. </li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the Cincinnati chili with chili powder, salt, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, whole cloves, whole allspice berries, and a bay leaf. </li>
    </ul>
